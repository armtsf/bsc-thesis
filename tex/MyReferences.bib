abstract = {The blockchain is the distributed ledger technology, and the unchangeability is the main feature. However, the scalability is hindered to satisfy the characteristic. Nowadays, there are more and more attempts to put many applications on block-chains, but there are problems in actual use, for example, the low number of processing transactions per second (tps). Since solving these problems can increase the performance of the blockchain and reduce the cost, to solve them is one of the most important issues in the blockchain; And it is called the scalability issue. In this paper, we analyze methods that various attempts to solve it into following categories: On-chain, Off-chain, Side-chain, Child-chain and Inter-chain. We will analyze how these methods in each category work, what their pros and cons are, and finally compare which scalability issue has been resolved and their own features.},

@article{Bano2017,
abstract = {B itcoin has become centralized and slow due to the inherent limitations of its blockchain. A number of alternative blockchain designs have been proposed to address these issues. Off-chain solutions allow for small and frequent transactions to take place over low-tier blockchain instances, parallel to and backed by the main blockchain. On-chain solutions directly modify the blockchain design to support high performance. We focus on the latter and summarize and discuss recent approaches to on-chain scaling of blockchains. Despite being founded on the ideals of openness and freedom of information, the Internet has become increasingly centralized, enabling a small number of big players to control who can access information. A number of proposals have emerged to counterbalance this trend such that information storage and processing is not concentrated in any single entity. Of these, blockchains are particularly promising, capturing the attention of popular media, research, and policy communities alike. A blockchain is an immutable and decentralized database that facilitates transparent and auditable management of data. It first gained traction as the underlying technology of Bitcoin [8] proposed in 2009, but it has since independently evolved thanks to its properties of resil-iency, integrity, and transparency. Yet Bitcoin suffers from scalability issues that impede its wider adoption. Over the past year, major divisions have emerged in the Bitcoin community over how Bitcoin should scale, as blocks of transactions have reached capacity, resulting in transaction fees skyrocketing. At the core of the debate is a simple tradeoff between scalabil-ity and centralization: the bigger the blockchain, the fewer devices will have the capacity to store and audit the full blockchain, leading to the network becoming more centralized. Some argue for using the Bitcoin blockchain as a settlement network for large transactions only-with smaller transactions being handled by payment hubs off the blockchain (off-chain scaling), while others argue for increasing the capacity of the blockchain itself for all types of transactions (on-chain scaling). As a result of the fallout, proponents of on-chain scaling recently forked the Bitcoin blockchain to create their own network called Bitcoin Cash. In this article, we provide an overview of key themes and options for on-chain scaling of blockchains. A blockchain serves as a decentralized database-or a distributed ledger-representing a consensus of synchronized, distributed, and replicated data (called blocks, representing sets of transactions). It is internally implemented as a linked list in which pointers to previous blocks have been replaced with cryptographic hash pointers (Figure 1). A pointer is simply the hash of some information (e.g., the previous block in this case) and serves to identify the information, as well as to verify its integrity. Each block in the blockchain contains a hash of the previous block and information specific to the current block.},

As we argue, there are several reasons to prefer an editable blockchain, spanning from the necessity to remove inappropriate content and the possibility to support applications requiring re-writable storage, to 'the right to be forgotten.' Our approach generically leverages so-called chameleon hash functions (Krawczyk and Rabin, NDSS '00), which allow determining hash collisions efficiently, given a secret trapdoor information. We detail how to integrate a chameleon hash function in virtually any blockchain-based technology, for both cases where the power of redacting the blockchain content is in the hands of a single trusted entity and where such a capability is distributed among several distrustful parties (as is the case with Bitcoin). We also report on a proof-of-concept implementation of a redactable blockchain, building on top of Nakamoto's Bitcoin core. The prototype only requires minimal changes to the way current client software interprets the information stored in the blockchain and to the current blockchain, block, or transaction structures. Moreover, our experiments show that the overhead imposed by a redactable blockchain is small compared to the case of an immutable one.},

@article{Dorri2019,
abstract = {The inherent immutability offered by Blockchains (BC) ensures resilience against modification or removal of the stored data. In large scale networks like the Internet of Things (IoT), however, this feature significantly increases BC storage size and raises privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose a Memory Optimized and Flexible BC (MOF-BC) that enables the IoT users and service providers to remove or summarize their transactions and age their data and thus exercise their “right to be forgotten”. To increase privacy, a user may employ multiple keys for different transactions. However, to facilitate removal of the stored transactions in the future, all keys would need to be stored which complicates key management and storage. MOF-BC introduces the notion of a Generator Verifier (GV) which is a signed hash of a Generator Verifier Secret (GVS). The GV changes for each transaction to provide privacy yet is signed by a unique key, thus minimizing the information that needs to be stored. A flexible transaction fee model and a reward mechanism is proposed to incentivize users to participate in optimizing memory consumption. We propose MOF-BC as a generalized solution, which can be implemented on top of any existing or future BC instantiation. Qualitative security and privacy analysis demonstrates that MOF-BC is resilient against several security attacks. Evaluation results show that MOF-BC decreases BC memory consumption by up to 25{\%} and the cost incurred by users by more than two orders of magnitude compared to conventional BC instantiations.},

abstract = {Blockchain is a distributed database that has advantage of being irreversible, transparent and decentralized. However, beside of its advantages, blockchain still face several challenges, one of them is scalability. One of the scalability challenges is increasing block size for every new transaction. The size of blockchain reached more than 180 GB. The block size will burden the node in conducting transaction verification. To overcome this problem, this paper has an objective to make summary blocks and compression for the summary blocks so that it can increase the space saving of blockchain and make it easier for nodes to verify transactions. The proposed method used for transactions whose entities can be transferred. This method combines block summarization algorithm and deflate compression algorithm. The proposed method applied to Bitcoin blockchain. Space saving is calculated by comparing the total size of original block with the total size of block that has been summarized and the total size of summary block which has been compressed. From the experiment results, the value of space saving for summary blocks is 22.318{\%} and space saving for summary blocks that have been compressed is 78.104{\%}.},

abstract = {Blockchain technology has received great attention in recent years. However, the data volume of blockchain grows continuously due to the features that cannot be deleted and can only be added. Currently, the total size of Bitcoin blockchain ledger has reached 200GB. Its high demand for storage space and bandwidth to synchronize data with the network prevents many nodes from joining the network.This is not only not conducive to the expansion of this decentralized network, but also becomes the bottleneck of the development of blockchain technology. This paper proposes an IPFS-based blockchain data storage model to solve this problem.In this paper, the miners deposit the transaction data into the IPFS network and pack the returned IPFS hash of transaction into the block. Utilizing the characteristics of the IPFS network and the features of the IPFS hash, the blockchain data is greatly reduced. The scheme is applied to the Bitcoin blockchain. According to the experimental results, the compression ratio can reach 0.0817. According to the analysis, it also has good performance in terms of security and synchronization speed of new node.},

Based on Bitcoin's blockchain protocol, Bitcoin-NG is Byzantine fault tolerant, is robust to extreme churn, and shares the same trust model obviating qualitative changes to the ecosystem. In addition to Bitcoin-NG, we introduce several novel metrics of interest in quantifying the security and efficiency of Bitcoin-like blockchain protocols. We implement Bitcoin-NG and perform large-scale experiments at 15{\%} the size of the operational Bitcoin system, using unchanged clients of both protocols. These experiments demonstrate that Bitcoin-NG scales optimally, with bandwidth limited only by the capacity of the individual nodes and latency limited only by the propagation time of the network.},

abstract = {VERSUM allows lightweight clients to outsource expensive computations over large and frequently changing data structures, such as the Bitcoin or Namecoin blockchains, or a Certificate Transparency log. VERSUM clients ensure that the output is correct by comparing the outputs from multiple servers. VERSUM assumes that at least one server is honest, and crucially, when servers disagree, VERSUM uses an efficient conflict resolution protocol to determine which server(s) made a mistake and thus obtain the correct output. VERSUM's contribution lies in achieving low server-side overhead for both incremental re-computation and conflict resolution, using three key ideas: (1) representing the computation as a functional program, which allows memoization of previous results; (2) recording the evaluation trace of the functional program in a carefully designed computation history to help clients determine which server made a mistake; and (3) introducing a new authenticated data structure for sequences, called SEQHASH, that makes it efficient for servers to construct summaries of computation histories in the presence of incremental re-computation. Experimental results with an implementation of VERSUM show that VERSUM can be used for a variety of computations, that it can support many clients, and that it can easily keep up with Bitcoin's rate of new blocks with transactions.},

abstract = {Almost all P2P crypto-currencies prevent double spending and similar such attacks with a bulky " blockchain " scheme, and the ones which do not typically use some sort of pseudo-decentralized solution to manage the transactions. Here we propose a purely P2P crypto-currency scheme where old transactions can be forgotten by the network. Since nodes only require the newest portion of the blockchain in order to sync with the network, we call this portion of the chain the " mini-blockchain " . We argue that the loss of security this trimming process incurs can be solved with a small " proof chain " and the loss of coin ownership data is solved with a database which holds the balance of all non-empty addresses, dubbed the " account tree " . The proof chain secures the mini-blockchain and the mini-blockchain secures the account tree. This paper will describe the way in which these three mechanisms can work together to form a system which provides a high level of integrity and security, yet is much slimmer than all other purely P2P currencies. It also offers other potential benefits such as faster transactions and lower fees, quicker network synchronization, support for high levels of traffic, more block space for custom messages, and potentially even increased anonymity.},

However, despite the growing importance of the subject, only a few researchers have done studies with respect to blockchain applications in tourism and travel industry. Therefore, this study aims to propose a blockchain basics criteria set that allows decision makers to compare various distributed applications (DAPPs). The proposed blockchain basics criteria in this research are as follows: blokchain governance model, blockchain platforms, type of consensus, use of crypto currency, smart contract and tokens. Then, based on the proposed criteria set, case analysis is employed by using secondary data obtained from four successful DAPPs. However, note that this study does not seek to justify the selected DAPPs. Finally, major issues regarding the BCT and the importance of the proposed criteria set are also discussed.

abstract = {This paper explores how the Internet of Things and blockchain technology can benefit shared economy applications. The focus of this research is understanding how blockchain can be exploited to create decentralised, shared economy applications that allow people to monetise, securely, their things to create more wealth. Shared economy applications such as Airbnb and Uber are well-known applications, but there are many other opportunities to share in the digital economy. With the recent interest in the Internet of Things and blockchain, the opportunity exists to create a myriad of sharing applications, e.g. peer-to-peer automatic payment mechanisms, foreign exchange platforms, digital rights management and cultural heritage to name but a few. While many types of shared economy scenarios are proliferating, few of them, so far, leverage the Internet of Things and blockchain as technologies to build distributed applications. This paper discusses how we might make use of the Internet of Things and blockchains to create secure shared economy distributed applications. Presented are examples of such distributed applications in the context of an Internet of Things architecture using blockchain technology.},

This work maps the research landscape through two means. The first is a comprehensive taxonomy of blockchain technology in authentication over networking. The second is identification of different types of authentication systems under various platforms that use blockchain technology. This work also provides useful and classified information which can enhance the understanding of how various authentication systems can be combined with blockchain technology. In addition, problems associated with this blockchain technology and proposed solutions are surveyed to fulfil the requirements of the network applications. Moreover, this work highlights the importance, capabilities, motivations and challenges of blockchain technology with distinct applications in various fields. Finally, recommendations and future research directions are discussed.},

abstract = {Transaction throughput, confirmation latency and confirmation reliability are fundamental performance measures of any blockchain system in addition to its security. In a decentralized setting, these measures are limited by two underlying physical network attributes: communication capacity and speed-of-light propagation delay. Existing systems operate far away from these physical limits. In this work we introduce Prism, a new proof-of-work blockchain protocol, which can achieve 1) security against up to 50{\%} adversarial hashing power; 2) optimal throughput up to the capacity C of the network; 3) confirmation latency for honest transactions proportional to the propagation delay D, with confirmation error probability exponentially small in CD ; 4) eventual total ordering of all transactions. Our approach to the design of this protocol is based on deconstructing the blockchain into its basic functionalities and systematically scaling up these functionalities to approach their physical limits.},

abstract = {A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},
